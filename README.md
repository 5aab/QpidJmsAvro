# QpidJmsAvro
Qpid Messaging with AVRO conversion

This is a sample project to convert a message to AVRO format and send it over QPID. You can replace QPID with any other broker supporting AMQP. This Sample project conatins examples for both, serialization and de-serialization. I've also included HTTP message converter to convert messages sent over http. Thanks
